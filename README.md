## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to generate a simple statistical analysis of the temperatures of Oahu, Hawaii during two months of the year, June and December. This analysis will provide insight into whether or not the surf and ice cream shop will be a sustainable to run year-round, rather than a seasonal business. By using June and December as the target months for queries, we can capture the temperature data to extract variables such as average, high and low temperatures. 

## Results
### June Temperature Analysis
As a result of the analysis, we have concluded that there are a total of 1,700 individual observations throughout the month of June. These observations encompass the data from 2010 through 2017. The average, minimum and maximum temperatures can be found in the image below. As we can also see from the June Temperature Analysis below, the standard deviation suggests a moderately small spread throughout the temperature observations. Given that Oahu weather does not appear to have a significant rise and fall, this is not a surprising conclusion.

### December Temperature Analysis
In contrast, December appears to have only 1,517 observations in total. This difference in data implies that at least some of the dates are missing temperature recordings. Despite the gap in data points this is still a well-rounded analysis. From the provided charts we can conclude that regardless of the different months taken from opposite times of the year, June and December are still close in average, high and low temperatures. Also noteworthy is the fact that the December spread is roughly the same as the June spread.

## Summary:
Through the comparison of the statistical summary of the two months of June and December, we can determine that despite the seasonal data set, the temperature patterns are continually steady throughout the entire year. Though temperatures may remain within a certain range throughout the year, the measurement of local rainfall may not be as consistent and could have a substantial effect on the year-round sustainability of the business. Therefore, we suggest doing a similar statistical summary of the precipitation patterns to capture data throughout the same months of June and December, as it will provide a healthier outlook of the complete weather patterns. An additional query that can be incorporated into our analysis is comparing the highest performing weather stations. Integrating this data will support the location search by providing the most popular areas accompanied by the regions with the most stable weather.
